## Constrains per Node

As part of the Aveiro face-to-face meeting, an initial design and requirements towards the reThink 
testbed nodes was presented ([presented slides](https://bscw.rethink-project.eu/bscw/bscw.cgi/d25103/Initial%20thoughts%20on%20Test%20Bed%20and%20Integration%20and%20Validation%20--%20Fraunhofer%20FOKUS%20Presentation.pdf)).  This documents captures deployment constrains for each testbed node.

*Please add any missing aspects / constrains that are relevant for your node.  The quesitons listed below should merely act as
a starting point.*

### Fraunhofer node / deployment constrains

* Will the testbed be accessible from outside the node premises via public IP?:  yes
* Number of available public IP-addresses:  1 public IPv4-address
* Access to the node:
    * Who will be allowed to have root-access to the node?:  local admins of node partner only
    * How can the node be accessed?:  personalized (public key based) login for reThink project partners only
    * Responsibilities / leagal constrains:
        * Project partner is responsible for deployed components und his/her account
    * Other 
        * Not clear at this moment if external users (e.g. hackatron user) may deploy data (e.g. upload Hyperty descirptions)
          via deployed components


### Orange node / deployment constrains

* Will the testbed be accessible from outside the node premises via public IP?:  yes/no

* Access to the node:
    * Who will be allowed to have root-access to the node?:  local admins of node partner / reThink partner / hackatron users
    * How can the node be accessed?:  please specify
    * Responsibilities / leagal constrains:
        * please specify or say _none_
    * Other 
        * please specify or say _n/a_

    * How can the node be accessed?:  please specify
    * Responsibilities / leagal constrains:
        * please specify or say _none_

    * How can the node be accessed?:  please specify
    * Responsibilities / leagal constrains:
        * please specify or say _none_
