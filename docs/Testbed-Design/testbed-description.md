### Requirements from D5.1
#### Smart Contextual assistance:
The following domains should be provided:
 * hybroker.rethink.ptinovacao.pt
 * hysmart.rethink.ptinovacao.pt
 * iHacker.rethink.ptinovacao.pt  
HyBroker should provide the following servers (and associated sub-domains):  
 * Vertx messaging node (node.broker.rethink.ptinovacao.pt)
 * Domain registry (registry.broker.rethink.ptinovacao.pt)
 * Catalogue server (catalogue.broker.rethink.ptinovacao.pt)
 * IdM server (idm.broker.rethink.ptinovacao.pt)
 * Global registry
 * TURN/STUN server

#### Hotel Guest
The testbed should have at least 3 virtual machines available for the Catalogue, the LWM2M Message Node and the Identity Manager Server/Identity Management Subsystem. The number of docker images depends on the implementation of these components. All 3 services should be accessible via public IP, be it only one that is shared and then NAT-ed, or reverse proxyfied towards the docker instances running the services or having a separate public IP for each service. A DNS server with SRV entries is needed in order that the setup can be replicated on several testbeds.

#### My City
A <My City domain> is required for My City implementation.  
DT lab should provide the following servers (and associated sub-domains):  
 * Node.js Messaging Node (node.< My City domain >)
