#### Hotel Guest
_The testbed should have at least 3 virtual machines available for the Catalogue, the LWM2M Message Node and the Identity Manager Server/Identity Management Subsystem._  
Implementation is to be determined (wheater it is deployed on 3 VMs or in 3 docker images in a VM with reverse proxyfication

#### My City
A <My City domain> is required for My City implementation.  
DT lab should provide the following servers (and associated sub-domains):  
 * Node.js Messaging Node (node.< My City domain >)
 * Domain Registry (registry.< My City domain >)
 * Catalogue server (catalogue.< My City domain >)
 * IdM Server (idm.< My City domain >)
 * Web server (web.< My City domain >)
 * Global Registry

#### Tourism in a smartcity
  * At least one messaging node 
  * At least one Domain Registry
  * At least one node of the Global Registry
  * At least one Catalog
  
#### Neigbourhood
Phase 1  
The following domains/network should be provided:  
* rethink.xxx.de (as global domain) for global registry, TURN server, â€¦
* talknow.rethink.xxx.de
* participate.rethink.xxx.de  
Participate should provide the following servers (and associated sub-domains):  
 * Participate Webserver hosting the Participate App (participate.rethink.xxx.de)
 * Matrix Messaging Node (msg-node.participate.rethink.xxx.de)
 * Domain Registry (dreg.participate.rethink.xxx.de)
 * Catalogue server (catalogue.participate.rethink.xxx.de)
 * Stub Server (stub.participate.rethink.xxx.de)
* Global Registry (greg.participate.rethink.xxx.de) - Note that the Global Registry can be provided by a CSP but is functionaly independant from the applications. I would suggest greg.participate.rethink.xxx.de -  
The TalkNow domain should provide the following servers (and associated sub-domains):  
* TalkNow Webserverhosting the TalkNow App (talknow.rethink.xxx.de)
 * Matrix Messaging Node (msg-node.talknow.rethink.xxx.de)
 * Domain Registry (dreg.talknow.rethink.xxx.de)
 * Catalogue server (catalogue.talknow.rethink.xxx.de)
 * Stub Server (stub.talknow.rethink.xxx.de)
* Global Registry (greg.talknow .rethink.xxx.de) - Same remark-   
The global domain should provide the following servers (and associated sub-domains):  
* Identity provider (ideasy.rethink.xxx.de)  
Phase 2  
 * Media Server for conferences

#### Enterprise conversational 
The following domains should be provided:  
* powercommunication.rethink.orange-labs.fr
Following servers (and associated sub-domains) should be provided:  
 * nodejs Messaging Node (node.powercommunication.rethink.orange-labs.fr)
 * Domain Registry (registry.powercommunication.rethink.orange-labs.fr)
 * Catalogue server (catalogue.rethink.orange-labs.fr)
* energyq.rethink.orange-labs.fr
* netall.rethink.orange-labs.fr  
* IdM Server (energyq.rethink.orange-labs.fr)
* QoS Service Broker Service (broker.netall.rethink.orange-labs.fr)
* Global Registry
* TURN/STUN server
* Nodejs runtime + MCU server
* Application server (app.powercommunication.rethink.orange-labs.fr)

#### Address book
 * at least one node of Global Registry
 * at least one CSP with a catalog

### Domain entries required, and applications provided on each
We consider that generally a CSP provides specific features that are hosted on the same place and provide sub domains:
 * node, 
 * domaine registry,
 * catalogue,
 * identity management (not to be mixed with IdP)

####*.rethink.ptinovacao.pt  
Applications:  
* hybroker: CSP and IdP (port 80 and 443)  
The different features of the CSP are provided in a subdomain (node.hybroker, registry.hybroker, catalogue.hybroker, idm.hybroker).  
hysmart is providing Hyperties related with IoT: CSP (probably port 443)  
* iHacker is an IdP (port 443)  

####My City domain : to be determined, Fokus or DT hosting  

####*.rethink.xxx.de: to be determined, Fokus or DT hosting  

####*.rethink.orange-labs.fr  
Applications:  
 * CSP powercommunication (ports 80, 443)
 * CSP energyq (ports 80, 443)
 * MCU Server -to be determined-

####*.rethink2.orange-labs.fr  
Applications:  
 * TURN/STUN server (ports 443, 3478, 3479, 5349, 5350, to be confirmed)
 * Global registry node (port 443).

####*.rethink3.orange-labs.fr  
Applications :  
 * QoS Service broker
 * netall

####Global registry
The global registry is dispatched on different domains (probably on orange-labs.fr, ptinovacao.pt, xxx.de). It can be independent of the CSPs or included. Each global registry node is linked in a way or another to the others, a CSP should be provided with at least one GR address (by configuration).
