 * Making docker images public:
  * WP lead raised this issue again at the last board telco on Feb 3rd, 2016:
    * We have *upcoming deliverables* that *include source code*.  Those deliverables are marked per contract as *public*
    * As we are contractually obliged to make the source code public in a few weeks, there is no need to provide private docker images.
  * **decision** of the board:  **docker images will be** proved as **public** images based on public source code.
