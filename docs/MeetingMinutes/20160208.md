 * no changes, approved
4. Review of open action items & open issues on GitHub
 * Making docker images public:
  * WP lead raised this issue again at the last board telco on Feb 3rd, 2016:
    * We have *upcoming deliverables* that *include source code*.  Those deliverables are marked per contract as *public*
    * As we are contractually obliged to make the source code public in a few weeks, there is no need to provide private docker images.
  * **decision** of the board:  **docker images will be** proved as **public** images based on public source code. 
  * Send e-mail to Marc to have a docker image publically accessible on docker hub.
 * Topography of the testbed ([issue #16](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/testbeds/issues/16))
   * **not reviewed as critical mass of partners did not attend the call** 
 * PT-node
   * Need additional infrastructure in order to deploy a docker image on the test nodes.  This basically means that we cannot deploy any reThink components on the (public accessible) PT-nodes.

5. M6.1 Testbed provisioning MileStone
6. AOB
 * Verification of testbed status:
   * For the upcoming milestone, assure that *reThink* components are accessbile from the public internet.  
   * Have test end of next week for each testbed node.
    * Test should allow to access one reThink component to be deployed on each partners' node and to be accessed from the Internet (i.e. from a computer with a public IP outside the infrastructure from the test node.
    * We have at least one set of docker images (the catalogue) that can be used for that test; but others can be used as well.
 * **Next phone call Feb 15 **
7. Adjourned at 14:18h
