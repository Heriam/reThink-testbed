## Agenda 

Meeting start: 14:00h CET

(1) Assignment of writing responsibilities for sections in deliverable.

(2) Identify next steps (and leading partners) for creating the testbed for IMS-reTHINK 
	integration.

Meeting ends no later than 15:00 CET.


General note:  we are contractual obliged to document on the IMS-reTHINK integration,
but we are not obliged to make the components of the IMS-reTHINK testbed available,
especially not under the public domain license.  So it is well possible to use existing
components at our companies for testing and demo purposes, to show that integration
works / can be done and then document this outcome in the deliverable.

## Discussed Topics

Added validation section.

Anton proposed to use token based approach. Discussions documented already in the md files. 

Next call: Wednesday 21.09 at 14:00.
