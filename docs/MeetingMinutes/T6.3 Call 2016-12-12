## Agenda 

Meeting start: 13:00h CET

(1) Assignment of writing responsibilities for sections in deliverable for sections 3-4-5.

(2) Identify next steps in implementation and documentation.

General note:  we are contractual obliged to document on the IMS-reTHINK integration,
but we are not obliged to make the components of the IMS-reTHINK testbed available,
especially not under the public domain license.  So it is well possible to use existing
components at our companies for testing and demo purposes, to show that integration
works / can be done and then document this outcome in the deliverable.

## Discussed Topics
what the migration path should contain
added section on IMS-other services interop, in case IMS-rethink and reTHINK-slack are giving this possibility

Items to clarify: authentication: opened an issue https://github.com/reTHINK-project/governance-security-implementation/issues/58

Contributions for sections 1-2-3 are expected until 17th of January.
Stub test for rethink to ims services to be provided by Quobis until 25th of January.
Deadline for D6.2 is end of february. Final contributions, including sections 4-5-6 expected until 19th of February.


Next call: Thursday 19.01 at 14:00.
