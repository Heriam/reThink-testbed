3. Status quo Testbeds
 * Fokus:
  * Node is up and running
  * Will have only 1 public IP, i.e. one node to access from the Internet
  * Node ready to run docker images with reThink Components
  * Project partners may obtain personalized accounts to access node
  * Need to open firewall at Fokus (ports) depending on hosted services
 * Orange:
  * Three running nodes
  * Docker images ready to be used
  * Ports might have to be opened on firewall (depending on offered services)
  * First components deployed, e.g. domain registry
  * Installed Reverse Proxy (Virtual hosts apache)
 * DT:
  * no status on testbed
  * WP lead sent e-mail asking to provide status
 * PT:
  * Nodes deployed
  * Docker files can be run
  * Open:  access of testbed from internet via public IP; right now only on internal network
4. Review of [Testbed Requirements from D5.1](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/testbeds/blob/master/docs/Testbed-Design/testbed-description.md)
 * Review of document.
 * Open questions: Will TUB be a 5th node in the testbed or will they move their components to DT?  [Opened an issue on this](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/testbeds/issues/23)
 * Document allows to map services / functional components as required for all WP5 scenarios to testbeds and (physical) systems.
 * All testbed partners are requesed to provide for their node an enhances figure similar to the one provided by Orange (with the docker images in it) wherein for each docker image, one should specify the service contained in the image.  Orange will provide the PPT file as a template.
5. Review of open action items & open issues on GitHub
 * Obsolete items closed
 * all partners are requested to close on their assigned / open issues
6. Next Steps
 * Provide updated figure for all testbed nodes per AI 20160111-03..06 for next telco, Jan 18
7. AOB
 * Requirement to have private Docker Hub images
  * Very likely to be needed
  * WP lead asked to discuss this at next Boad Call, i.e to initiate aquisition of private docker images / enhance existing docker hub account.
 * **Next phone call upcoming Monday, Jan 18.**
