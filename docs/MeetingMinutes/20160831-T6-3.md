## Agenda 

Meeting start: 10:00h CET

(1) Update ToC
  * look at the ToC and add "missing pieces"
	  * we should have two major parts in the document
    * (a) a theoretical / background discussion on IMS-reTHINK integration
			that lists all potential issues and aspects to consider
	    * (b) identify which of those are basically "done by existing (commercial) solutions", e.g.
			we do not need to work on recoding audio / codec changes in reTHINK
      * (c) major challenges / open issues for interoperability
        * we at least identified the addressing issue in previous discussions
      * (d) plans for testbed / proof of concept

(2) Description of testbed set-up / functionality
  * this is closely related to item (1d)

(3) Assignment of writing responsibilities for sections in deliverable.
  * as we need the background information to decide what to put in the testbed,
		we suggest to write that information immediately down (and not wait
		until we have to deliver the document).  That relaxes the writing period
		for D6.2

(4) Identify next steps (and leading partners) for creating the testbed for IMS-reTHINK 
	integration.

Meeting ends no later than 11:30 CET.


General note:  we are contractual obliged to document on the IMS-reTHINK integration,
but we are not obliged to make the components of the IMS-reTHINK testbed available,
especially not under the public domain license.  So it is well possible to use existing
components at our companies for testing and demo purposes, to show that integration
works / can be done and then document this outcome in the deliverable.
