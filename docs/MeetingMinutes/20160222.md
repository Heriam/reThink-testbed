3. Approval of Agenda
 * no changes, approved
4. Status Quo Testbed Nodes
 * Fokus node:
   * Firewall has been opened --> node is accessible from the public internet
   * node is running a reTHINK catalogue instance that is accessible via http (broker, database with example entries, and catalogue web testsite)
   * Remaining issue:  https support
     * request for Fraunhofer Cert issued
 * DT node:
   * filed the internal "privace and securtiy assessment"; waiting for reply / further clarification requests
   * tested docker images for rev proxy; extended them to support Websocket.  All working.
   * Having finished the docker tests, *DT supports the docker-based approach for all deployments on the testbeds*
   * Question: Is it possible to *dynamically configure the VirtualHosts in the reverse proxy*?
     * in general yes, but we have not done the work so far.  Googling the issues seems to give believe that it can be done.
     * Opening a related issue on this. (#34)
 * Orange node:
   * 
 * PT node:
   * Current status (from previous calls):  Need additional infrastructure in order to deploy a docker image on the test nodes.  **This basically means that we cannot deploy any reThink components on the (public accessible) PT-nodes as of today.**

4. Review of open action items & open issues on GitHub
 * Topography of the testbed ([issue #16](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/testbeds/issues/16))
   * **not reviewed as critical mass of partners did not attend the call** 
5. M6.1 Testbed provisioning MileStone
 * Verification of testbed status:
   * For the upcoming milestone, assure that *reThink* components are accessbile from the public internet.  
   * Have test end of next week for each testbed node.
    * Test should allow to access one reThink component to be deployed on each partners' node and to be accessed from the Internet (i.e. from a computer with a public IP outside the infrastructure from the test node.
    * We have at least one set of docker images (the catalogue) that can be used for that test; but others can be used as well.
    * How to practicall do this?
      * Fokus node: access catalogue from public (fokus-external) IP. Works.
      * DT: cannot test this as public access is not possible at this time
        * If this cannot be done by the end of the week, DT has to provide a written summary of the status of its testbed node and an explanation / justification for the delay to include this in the MS-report.
      * Orange:
      * PT:
