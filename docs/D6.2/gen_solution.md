3. General Solution Design

Goal: interoperability

Relating to key IMS and reTHINK functional element equivalents.

Key common services: registration, something else?

Client side – Infrastructure components (rethink/IMS core components) – services

IMS gateway, sip protostub, Idm concept equivalent, dynamic subscriber allocation

Rethink: Identity model: different identities-> Idp proxies (implement the idm protocol); Idp server: exposes API

IMS: S-CSCF authenticates the user via algorithms, identity keys retrieved from IMS
