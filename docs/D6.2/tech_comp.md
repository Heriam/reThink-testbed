2.3	Technology Comparison -DT-

2.3.1	Overall Functional requirements

Rich communication services | Scenarios | reTHINK Functional Requirements | IMS Functional Requirements	
----------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------
Chat|	My City, Neighborhood	| Message Passing, Discovery|	Message delivery, Registration information	
Audio, video calls |	Smart Contextual Assistance, Enterprise Conversational | Authentication, Authorization, dynamic subscriber provisioning & discovery | Authentication, Authorization, SIP sessions	
Mutiparty-calls	| |
Presence | Smart Contextual Assistance	| |
Emergency services | | |	Authorize calls to well-known numbers/URNs, Location services	
Smart Location	| |	|	Location services	

2.3.2	Functional equivalents

Components responsible for the common functional requirements (Maybe another way of visualizing it); Registration and Call Setup are procedures, AAA is functional requirementâ€¦

Functional Requirement (Procedures) |	IMS Component (Technology) | reTHINK Component (Technology) |	Equivalent relationship	Comments
------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------
Registration | 						
Call Setup   |	P-CSCF, I-CSCF, S-CSCF, E-CSCF	(SIP) |	Message Node	(Javascript) |
Authentication |	Diameter			|	|
Authorization	|	Diameter			|	|	
Accounting	|	Diameter?			|	|	
Service Enablement |	IFC in S-CSCF	(SIP)|	Hyperties	(Javascript) |
Location services  |	Server side: LRF, client side: ? (PDF-LO location objects in SIP body) | |				

Functional requirements that are not in common: Emergency call recognition, considered for reTHINK follow-up projects.
