Migration Report D6.2

1 Introduction

1.1. Objectives

This document aims to provide the design of the migration path that a IMS and reTHINK infrastructures have to undergo in order to be interoperable in the sense that an IMS User Endpoint can consume reTHINK services and the other way round. 
Based on the use cases and user scenarios described in D5.1, this document describes a technology migration path for communication services, as the key services that are deployed on Telecom infrastructures targeted to be interoperable with reTHINK services.

1.2. Methodology

In order to achieve the objectives of this document, the following methodology was applied:
* Starting from a comparison of the architecture, enabled services from 3GPP IMS and reTHINK technology and extracting the key functional elements. As a result the equivalent of the functional elements in both the architectures is analysed
* Identify fundamental system migration requierements and design general solutions of migration in order to enable the services. 
* Key research aspects for reTHINK service endpoints to consume IMS services
* Theoretical validating the solutions for each selected service
