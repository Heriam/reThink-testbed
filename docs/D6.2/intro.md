Migration Report D6.2

1. Introduction

1.1. Objectives
This document aims to provide the design of all service scenarios aspects to be implemented and deployed in testbeds. 
Based on the use cases and user scenarios described in D1.1[2] from the “User Scenarios and Use Cases description” work, 
this document describes a selection of usage scenarios that will showcase the reTHINK results detailing the features and 
functionalities of the use cases and designing the hyperties and applications involved in them. 
The result is the specification of all aspects of the use cases, covering the end-points, the core network services and 
the overall communication scenarios. 

1.2. Methodology
In order to achieve the objectives of this document, the following methodology was applied:
•	Starting from a comparison of the architecture, enabled services from 3GPP IMS and reTHINK technology and extracting the key functional elements. As a result the equivalent of the functional elements in both the architectures is analysed
•	Identify fundamental system migration requierements and design general solutions of migration in order to enable the services. 
•	Key research aspects for reTHINK service endpoints to consume IMS services
•	Theoretical validating the solutions for each selected service
