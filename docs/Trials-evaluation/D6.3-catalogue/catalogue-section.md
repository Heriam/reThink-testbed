##### Catalogue (Marc, Fokus)
###### Description of Component
Short description (1 paragraph, approx. 5-8 lines) describing the component under test

The Catalogue provides the service to store descriptors of Hyperties available for use. It also provides the means for the runtime to obtain (download) the implementation of a Hyperty and ProtocolStubs required for SigOFly after learning about a Hyperty from the Registry Service. [D4.1]

###### Metrics
Description of metrics used to test the components.  Should include:
  * What is tested (i.e. metric description)
  * For each metric:
    * reasoning why this metric matters for the component under test
    * expected performance (based on use cases under consideration, e.g. number of parallen interacting end-nodes, requests per second, delay of a querry-response, size of data exchanged etc; target values based on real-world deployments).

###### Tests
Description of test set up, may be a single set up or multiple set ups depending on the component under test and the metric being tested.
If you have a single test set-up, describe the test set up first and then include one sub-section per metric being tested.  If you need several different test set ups, use a "strucutre by metric", i.e., have one subsection per metric which in turn includes the description of the test set up for that metric and the results.
