## Trial Evaluations, Business and Architecture Assessment

This folder contains material related with the evaluation of the performance of the reTHINK framework that is performed during the trials with reTHINK demonstrators and during the hackathons in WP7. The evaluation will contain on the one hand technical information but also feedback from hackathon participants that will be collected during the events. This feedback together with technical performance records will be used for an architecture and business assessment. Such evaluation and assessment are reported in D6.3 (June 2016 and June 2017).

The following plan is proposed including required input from other WPs or Tasks:

* WP1: Business assessment criteria

* WP2: Architecture assessment criteria

* WP3: Core Framework logs with data required for the assessment

* WP4: Support Services logs with data required for the assessment

* WP5: Questionaire to be answered by WP5 Developers

* T6.2: Perform tests, collect and store logs

* WP7: reuse WP5 questionaire in the pre-hackathon. Questionaire for scenario users
