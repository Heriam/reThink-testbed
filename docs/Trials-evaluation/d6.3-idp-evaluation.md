**Description of Component**

The Identity Provider (IdP) provides a service that autenticates users, provides proofs of past authentication process 
(called _identity assertions_), and checks the validity of these assertions.  
It also provides IdP-Proxy to Id-Module deployed on the runtime so that this Id-Module may interact with IdP with the relevant protocol.

2 Identity Providers have been customised and deployed for demonstration purpose. They implement OpenID Connect specifications.

**Metrics**

Since IdP is a purely request-based service, the most relevant KPIs would characterize response time : for instance average response time and 9th decile.
- for authentication requests,
- for assertion generation,
- for assertion verification.

However IdP requests per user should be scarce compared to communication-related exchanges, especially on our testbeds which constitute more of a prototype environment.

Indeed IdPs are peripheral support services and will not be critical in evaluating overall environment performance. As a matter of fact they are existing (almost 'legacy') platforms whose functions are needed within reTHINK project.

**Tests**

No actual perofrmance tests planned.
