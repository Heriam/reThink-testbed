**Description of Component**

The Identity Provider (IdP) provides a service that autenticates users, provides proofs of past authentication process 
(called _identity assertions_), and checks the validity of these assertions.  
It also provides IdP-Proxy to Id-Module deployed on the runtime so that this Id-Module may interact with IdP with the relevant protocol.

2 Identity Providers have been customised and deployed for demonstration purpose. They implement OpenID Connect specifications.

**Metrics**

Since we are in prototype environment...

Description of metrics used to test the components.  Should include:
  * What is tested (i.e. metric description)
  * For each metric:
    * reasoning why this metric matters for the component under test
    * expected performance (based on use cases under consideration, e.g. number of parallen interacting end-nodes, requests per second, delay of a querry-response, size of data exchanged etc; target values based on real-world deployments).

**Tests**

Description of test set up, may be a single set up or multiple set ups depending on the component under test and the metric being tested.
If you have a single test set-up, describe the test set up first and then include one sub-section per metric being tested.  If you need several different test set ups, use a "strucutre by metric", i.e., have one subsection per metric which in turn includes the description of the test set up for that metric and the results.
