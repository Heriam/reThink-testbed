This docker image (rethink/catalogue-database-reTHINKdefault) provides a
reTHINK database that contains default catalogue objects as developed by reTHINK.

If you want to deploy your own (= outside the scope of the reThink project)
catalogue objects (via a docker image), you may  

1) recursively copy this directory  
2) to to your copy :-=  
3) delete all existing catalogue objects  
4) add your own objects  
5) do a docker build -t=NameOfYourDockerImage .  
  
For details on how to populate catalogue objects, please refer to the catalogue
documentation on github.
